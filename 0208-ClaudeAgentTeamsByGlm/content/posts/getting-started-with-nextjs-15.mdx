# Getting Started with Next.js 15

Next.js 15 brings exciting new features and improvements that make building web applications faster and more enjoyable. In this guide, we'll explore the key features and walk through building your first Next.js 15 application.

## What's New in Next.js 15

Next.js 15 introduces several game-changing features:

- **Improved App Router**: Better performance and developer experience
- **Enhanced Server Actions**: More seamless server-side mutations
- **Partial Prerendering**: Hybrid static and dynamic rendering
- **Turbopack**: Faster builds and hot reload in development

## Setting Up Your Project

To create a new Next.js 15 project, use the following command:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app
```

During setup, you'll be asked about:
- TypeScript support
- ESLint configuration
- Tailwind CSS integration
- App Router usage

## Understanding the App Router

The App Router is built on React Server Components, enabling:

- Automatic code splitting
- Streaming and suspense
- Built-in layouts and loading states
- Improved data fetching patterns

### Creating Your First Route

Create a new file in the `app` directory:

```tsx
// app/about/page.tsx
export default function AboutPage() {
  return (
    <main>
      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p>Welcome to our about page!</p>
    </main>
  );
}
```

## Data Fetching in Next.js 15

Server Components allow direct async/await for data fetching:

```tsx
async function BlogPosts() {
  const posts = await fetch('https://api.example.com/posts').then(r => r.json());

  return (
    <ul>
      {posts.map((post) => (
        <li key={post.id}>{post.title}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}
```

## Styling with Tailwind CSS v4

Next.js 15 pairs beautifully with Tailwind CSS v4 for rapid UI development:

```tsx
export default function Card() {
  return (
    <div className="bg-white rounded-lg shadow-md p-6">
      <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Card Title</h2>
      <p className="text-gray-600">Card content goes here.</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Deployment

Deploy your Next.js 15 application to Vercel with a single command:

```bash
vercel deploy
```

## Conclusion

Next.js 15 provides everything you need to build modern, performant web applications. With its powerful features and excellent developer experience, it's the perfect choice for your next project.

Happy coding!
